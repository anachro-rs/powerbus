//! [`defmt`](https://github.com/knurling-rs/defmt) global logger over RTT.
//!
//! NOTE when using this crate it's not possible to use (link to) the `rtt-target` crate
//!
//! To use this crate, link to it by importing it somewhere in your project.
//!
//! ```
//! // src/main.rs or src/bin/my-app.rs
//! use defmt_rtt as _;
//! ```
//!
//! # Blocking/Non-blocking
//!
//! `probe-run` puts RTT into blocking-mode, to avoid losing data.
//!
//! As an effect this implementation may block forever if `probe-run` disconnects on runtime. This
//! is because the RTT buffer will fill up and writing will eventually halt the program execution.
//!
//! `defmt::flush` would also block forever in that case.
